			<h2>Timeline</h2>
			<p>When I first started my career as a freelance developer I started with frontend web development and interface design. As time progressed, I found myself having a calling for product design and backend development. I am currently seeking opportunities that help me expand these core values to grow my current skill set.</p>

			<h2>Relevant Work</h2>
			<p>My latest projects required development of user interfaces that implemented the latest web technology standards available today. Several of these projects consisted of creating internal applications, micro-services as well as websites that were visited by thousands of users per month.</p>
